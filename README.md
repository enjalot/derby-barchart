# derby-barchart

This simple app shows how to make a derby component out of a reusable chart.  

The reusable chart was ported from this Backbone example: http://bl.ocks.org/milroc/5522467  

You can take advantage of the powerful parts of d3 while making all your data react in real-time with derby/racer!
